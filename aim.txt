Objective:

To develop a machine learning-powered audio analyzer that can accurately:

1. Detect the musical key and scale (e.g., C Major, A# Minor),
2. Estimate the tempo (BPM) of a track,
3. Classify the general type of audio (e.g., music, speech, ambient, mechanical),
â€¦all from a single audio file using a shared feature learning model and deploy it as an interactive Streamlit application.


Problem Formulation:

Input: An audio file (e.g., .wav, .mp3)
Output:
    Key: One of 12 tonal keys (C, C#, ..., B)
    Scale: Major / Minor
    BPM: A continuous numerical value (regression)
    Audio Type: One of [music, speech, ambient, mechanical] (classification)
