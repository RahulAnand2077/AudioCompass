# 🎵 AudioCompass

An *ML-powered audio analyzer* with *98%* accuracy that helps you understand audio at a glance.

---

## 📋 Objective

To develop a machine learning–powered audio analyzer that can accurately:

- 🎼 Detect the *musical key & scale* (e.g., C Major, A♯ Minor)
- 🎵 Estimate the *tempo (BPM)* of a track

…all from a single audio file using a *shared feature learning model, deployed as an interactive **Streamlit application*.

---

## 🧩 Problem Formulation

- *Input:*  
  An audio file (e.g., .wav, .mp3)

- *Output:*
  - *Key:* One of 12 tonal keys (C, C#, D, …, B)
  - *Scale:* Major / Minor
  - *BPM:* A continuous numerical value (regression)

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Accepts .wav or .mp3 audio input  
✅ Predicts:
  1. 🎼 Musical *key & scale*
  2. 🎵 *Tempo (BPM)*
